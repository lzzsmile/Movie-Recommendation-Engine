# Movie-Recommendation-Engine

The IDE for this web application is Eclipse, using Java, HTML, and Tomcat Server. 

Search the database, and find raters that share the same interest with the current rater. 
Assign weight to these raters, i.e. similarity. Sort the list of found raters from high 
similarity to low similarity. Set a number X to represent the minimal similar raters used to choose a movie, 
and if a movie has a number of top similar raters which is larger than X, this movie will be 
recommended to the current rater.
